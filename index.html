         <p>Hi! My name is Matt. I have an interesting story. I first became interested in web development around June of 2020.
            My brother got me interested in it and I was excited to learn. I started out on mooc learning java. When I realized how hard teaching myself how to code I initially gave up.
            Then I picked it up again about 4 months later. Eager to learn, my brother mentioned a bootcamp to me. I tried to attend LSU because it was close to home
            and it had a good schedule. Unfortunetly, or should I say fortuntely, the schedule wasn't good enough. However, I refused to give up again. I kept looking and
            again, my brother came in and mentioned Lambda. Seriously if it wouldn't be for him, I wouldn't be nearly in the spot I am in right now. He gave me the push I needed.
            So I got into Lambda on 2/14/2021, and my coding journey began officaly. I was excited and nervous at the same time. I didn't know how hard
            it was going to be and who I would meet. I still have a long way to go before I can consider myself any kind of developer. I know I wil fail and I know its going
            to be far from easy, BUT I am prepared and I WILL NOT give up. <br>
